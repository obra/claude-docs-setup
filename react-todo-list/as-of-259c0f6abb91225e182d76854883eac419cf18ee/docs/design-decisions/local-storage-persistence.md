# Using localStorage for Data Persistence

## Decision

We chose to use the browser's localStorage API for persisting todo items.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **IndexedDB**:
   - Pro: More powerful, supports larger amounts of data, transactions
   - Con: More complex API, overkill for this application's needs

2. **SessionStorage**:
   - Pro: Similar API to localStorage
   - Con: Data is lost when the browser tab is closed

3. **Backend API with database**:
   - Pro: Data can be accessed from multiple devices, more robust
   - Con: Requires server setup, adds complexity, beyond current requirements

4. **No persistence**:
   - Pro: Simplest implementation
   - Con: Poor user experience as todos are lost on page refresh

## Rationale

1. **Simplicity**: localStorage provides a simple, synchronous API that's easy to work with.

2. **Built-in browser support**: No additional libraries needed, works in all modern browsers.

3. **Sufficient for requirements**: For a simple todo list, localStorage can handle the expected amount of data.

4. **No backend required**: Allows the application to function as a standalone frontend without server dependencies.

5. **Persistence across sessions**: Unlike sessionStorage, data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

## Implementation Details

- We've encapsulated localStorage interactions in utility functions for clean separation of concerns
- We store the entire todo list array as a single JSON string under one key
- We've implemented automatic loading and saving of todos when the app loads and when the todo list changes

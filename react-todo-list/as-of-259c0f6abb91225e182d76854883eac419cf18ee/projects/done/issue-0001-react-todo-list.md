# React Todo List with Local Storage

## Problem
Create a simple React Todo List application that persists tasks using localStorage.

## Approach
Build a React application with the following features:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Persist tasks in localStorage
- Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up React project with Vite
2. Create component structure:
   - App
   - TodoForm (for adding new tasks)
   - TodoList (container for todo items)
   - TodoItem (individual todo item)
   - FilterButtons (for filtering todos)
3. Implement localStorage functionality
4. Add styles
5. Add tests for components and localStorage functionality

## Tasks
- [x] Set up project with Vite
- [x] Implement component structure
- [x] Add localStorage persistence
- [x] Add filtering functionality
- [x] Add styling
- [x] Write tests
- [x] Document code and usage

## Testing
- Unit tests for components using Vitest and React Testing Library
- Manual testing of localStorage persistence

## Documentation
- README with setup and usage instructions
- Code comments for complex logic
- Design decisions documented in `/docs/design-decisions/`

## Implementation
Implemented directly in the main project, no separate branch was created.

The implementation includes:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component tests with Vitest and React Testing Library
- localStorage utilities for data persistence
- CSS styling with responsive design
- Filterable todo list (All, Active, Completed)

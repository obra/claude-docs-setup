## Tasks
- [ ] Plan your implementation
- [ ] Ensure that all implementation tasks are listed in this TODO list

## Gate 1: Pre-Implementation (STOP HERE)
Before writing ANY implementation code, confirm completion of:
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper branch
- [ ] Required directories created
- [ ] Issue design decisions documented
- [ ] Stand up from your desk and scream out loud "WE DO TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT. I WILL NOT WRITE ANY CODE UNTIL I WRITE AND RUN A FAILING TEST FOR THE THING I AM DOING"
- [ ] Unit test files created 
- [ ] End to end test files created 
- [ ] Integration test files created
- [ ] New unit tests run and verified failing
- [ ] New integration tests run and verified failing
- [ ] New end to end tests run and verified failing

## Gate 2: Mid-Implementation Review
After implementing core functionality but before completing the solution:
- [ ] Verify all completed code adheres to ALL requirements in this file
- [ ] Check for drift from documented design decisions
- [ ] Confirm test coverage for all implemented features

## Gate 3: Pre-Completion Verification
Before declaring the task complete:
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands (tests, linting, typechecking)
- [ ] Ensure documentation is complete per standards above
- [ ] Verify all git commits follow required format
- [ ] Verify all automated tests pass, including end-to-end tests

## Gate 4: Pre-Submission Quality Checks
Before declaring ANY implementation complete, perform these mandatory checks:
- Ensure all types of tests are present, have been run, and are passing.
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests 
   - [ ] End-to-end tests

## Gate 5: Final commit for the issue
   - [ ] Author a meaningful commit message for this change. Include details of your intent, as well as logs showing that you ran tests and that they passed.

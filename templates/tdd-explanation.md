# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be implemented. This approach ensures that the code meets the specified requirements and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

## The TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)

### 1. Red: Write a Failing Test
- Write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function
- The test should fail initially because the function isn't implemented yet

### 2. Green: Make the Test Pass
- Implement the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass
- Focus on functionality, not optimization

### 3. Refactor: Improve the Code
- Clean up the code while keeping the tests passing
- Improve design, remove duplication, enhance readability

## Benefits of TDD

- **Reduced Bugs**: Catches issues early in the development process
- **Better Design**: Forces modular, loosely coupled code
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation for how the code should behave
- **Confidence in Changes**: Makes refactoring safer
- **Focused Development**: Helps developers focus on requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Write Minimal Tests**: Tests should be focused on a single behavior
2. **Keep Tests Fast**: Slow tests discourage regular testing
3. **Independent Tests**: Tests should not depend on each other
4. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Tests should verify what the code does, not how it does it
5. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Ensure all code paths are covered by tests

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components or functions in isolation
- Fast to run and focused on specific functionality

### Integration Tests
- Test how components work together
- Verify that separate parts of the system integrate correctly

### End-to-End Tests
- Test entire workflows from start to finish
- Simulate real user behavior

## TDD Implementation Steps

1. Identify a new feature or bug fix
2. Write a failing test that would pass if the feature was implemented or bug was fixed
3. Run the test to confirm it fails
4. Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass
5. Run the test to confirm it passes
6. Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests passing
7. Repeat for each new feature or bug fix
